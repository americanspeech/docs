# This is the repository for documents of American Speech and Debate Association (ASDA)

American Speech and Debate Association’s mission is to prepare the next generation of leaders by providing competitive speech and debate events where youth learn to communicate their ideas, beliefs, and values effectively while maintaining respect for differing views.

To accomplish this mission, ASDA:
* embraces those values found in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution such as freedom of speech and religion.
* cultivates an atmosphere of collaboration and congeniality where freedom of conscience in all religious beliefs and political stances is honored.
* accepts youth from all learning environments.

This repository will be used to hold all ASDA public documents such as the Handbook, Tournament Manual, etc.
